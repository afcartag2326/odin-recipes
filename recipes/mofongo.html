    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        My personal favorite carribean dish. A true
        homage to my roots.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Green Plantains</li>
        <li>1lb Chicharron</li>
        <li>3 Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>4 TSP Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2 Cups Canola Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Peel the plantains, cut them into 1.5 inch
            slices, soak them in salty cold-weather
            for 15 minutes, dran them and dry before putting
            on hot skillet with oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry for about 12 minutes at medium-low heat or until they turn light brown.
            Make sure to turn them. Do not brown them too much, so they are easy to mash.
            Stick a fork in them to check if they are done.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove plantains and mash them on a mortar.
            Add some mashed garlic and pieces of chicharron.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you have mashed all plantains, mold them into
            the shape of half sphere using your hands overa container. 
            Serve hot with chicken broth or your favorite meat.
        </li>
    </ol>
